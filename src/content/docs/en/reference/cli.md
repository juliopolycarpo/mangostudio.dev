# CLI Reference

MangoStudio ships as a single binary that doubles as a CLI for running and
managing one local server. The same commands work from the installed binary
(`mangostudio`) and from source (`bun run apps/api/src/index.ts <command>`).

## Install channels

Pick any distribution channel — each ships the same prebuilt binary and frontend
sidecar. See the [README install matrix](/en/docs/quickstart#install) for
copy-paste commands, or:

| Channel            | Entry point                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## Commands

| Command                            | Description                                                    |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `mangostudio`                      | Print help and the command list.                               |
| `serve [host\|port\|host:port]`    | Start the server in the foreground (default `localhost:3001`). |
| `serve [host\|port\|host:port] -d` | Start the server in the background (detached) and return.      |
| `status`                           | Show whether a server is running and its details.              |
| `stop`                             | Gracefully stop the running server (SIGTERM).                  |
| `killserver`                       | Force-kill the running server (SIGKILL).                       |
| `doctor`                           | Run environment and configuration diagnostics.                 |
| `version`, `--version`, `-v`       | Print the embedded MangoStudio version.                        |

`-d` / `--detach` and the positional host/port target may be combined in any
order, e.g. `mangostudio serve 127.0.0.1:3000 -d`.

Host aliases: `lan`, `all`, `any`, and `public` bind `0.0.0.0`; `local` binds
`127.0.0.1`.

## Examples

```bash
mangostudio serve              # foreground on localhost:3001
mangostudio serve 3000         # foreground on localhost:3000
mangostudio serve 127.0.0.1 -d # background on 127.0.0.1:3001
mangostudio serve lan:3000 -d  # background on 0.0.0.0:3000
mangostudio --version
mangostudio status
mangostudio stop
```

## How background mode works

`serve -d` re-executes the same binary with a hidden `__serve` subcommand as a
detached child process (via `Bun.spawn` with `detached` + `unref`). The parent
redirects the child's stdout/stderr to a timestamped log file, waits for the
server to report healthy, prints the PID and log path, then exits. The child
keeps running independently.

The detached child does **not** inherit the parent shell's full environment: it
is launched with a minimal allowlist (runtime config plus the system/networking
variables the server needs) so connector secrets never land in a long-lived
process environment. The child instead loads provider keys from `~/.mango/.env`
on startup. Set provider keys such as `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `~/.mango/.env` rather
than exporting them in your shell — a shell-only export reaches a foreground
`serve` but is dropped by a background (`-d`) start.

## Single instance

Only one server may run at a time. On startup the server writes a state file at
`~/.mango/run/server.json` (`{ pid, port, host, startedAt, logFile, version }`)
once the port is bound, and removes it on graceful shutdown. A second
`serve` / `serve -d` reads that file and refuses to start if the recorded
process is still alive. A state file whose process has died is treated as stale
and cleaned up automatically.

## Runtime files

| Path                         | Contents                                           |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `~/.mango/run/server.json`   | Single-instance state file for the running server. |
| `~/.mango/logs/server-*.log` | Output of background (`-d`) server runs.           |

These live under `~/.mango` in both development and standalone modes so
`status`/`stop` resolve the same instance regardless of how it was launched.
Foreground `serve` logs to the terminal instead of a file.

## Exit codes

- `0` — success (including idempotent `stop`/`status` when nothing is running).
- `1` — usage error (bad flag or port), refused start (already running), failed
  background start, or a `stop` that timed out (try `killserver`). `doctor`
  exits `1` if any check fails.

## Configuration

Host, port, and other settings follow the standard resolution order
(`process.env` → `.env` next to `config.toml` → `config.toml` → defaults). A positional
host/port on `serve` is applied as `API_HOST` / `API_PORT` before the server
reads its config. See
[`apps/api/src/lib/config.ts`](../../apps/api/src/lib/config.ts) and
[`packages/cli/README.md`](https://github.com/juliopolycarpo/mangostudio/blob/c8a260ecd3cf98c5fb630b756a93afe762cb2af8/packages/cli/README.md) for the full environment.

If no auth secret is configured, interactive `mangostudio serve` generates a
strong `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` and asks whether to persist it in `~/.mango/.env`
or `~/.mango/config.toml` before starting.
