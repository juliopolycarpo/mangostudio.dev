# Tooling

## Turborepo

This monorepo uses [Turborepo](https://turborepo.dev) **2.x** (currently
`2.9.16`) as its shared build-system layer. Turborepo orchestrates task
execution across workspaces and provides a content-addressable cache so that
unchanged work is never rebuilt.

### Policy

- **Stable 2.x only.** The pinned version in the root `package.json` is the
  single source of truth. No canary builds, no floating ranges.
- **No Remote Cache yet.** Local cache only until the task model is proven.
- **Root Bun wrappers are the public interface.** `bun run dev`, `bun run build`,
  `bun run check`, and `bun run test` remain the canonical commands. Turborepo
  is invoked through them or via the `turbo:*` inspection scripts.

### Configuration

The task graph lives in `turbo.jsonc` at the repository root. The `.jsonc`
extension is used so that inline comments can document migration decisions.

Current task definitions:

| Task               | Cache | Outputs / Env                                      | Notes                                        |
| ------------------ | ----- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `dev`              | off   | —                                                  | Persistent — runs dev servers                |
| `build`            | on    | `dist/**`; env `VITE_*`                            | Depends on upstream `^build`; restores dist  |
| `check:quick`      | on    | —                                                  | Lint / format; inputs scoped to `biome.json` |
| `typecheck`        | on    | —                                                  | Inputs scoped to root `tsconfig.json`        |
| `circular`         | on    | —                                                  | Circular dependency detection                |
| `test:unit`        | on    | env `DATABASE_PATH`, `CI`, `MANGOSTUDIO_*`         | Unit tests                                   |
| `test:integration` | off   | env `DATABASE_PATH`, `CI`, `MANGOSTUDIO_*`         | Integration tests (always re-run)            |
| `test:coverage`    | off   | `$TURBO_ROOT$/.mango/artifacts/coverage/**`; env ↑ | Coverage reports (always re-run)             |
| `//#test:scripts`  | on    | inputs `scripts/**`                                | Root scripts tests (cached via turbo)        |

### Inspection Scripts

| Script                  | Purpose                                       |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `bun run turbo:version` | Print the installed Turborepo version         |
| `bun run turbo:dry`     | Dry-run the build graph (JSON output)         |
| `bun run turbo:graph`   | Export the build graph to `.turbo/graph.html` |

### Cache Directory

Turborepo writes its local task-output cache to `.turbo/cache` at the repository
root. This directory is gitignored and should never be committed.

CI persists the local Turbo cache with `actions/cache` in the check, test, and
build lanes. Each lane uses a separate key prefix so the lanes never share a
cache entry — each saves and restores only its own snapshot:

```text
${{ runner.os }}-${{ env.CACHE_VERSION }}-turbo-<lane>-${{ github.sha }}
```

The `github.sha` suffix makes every successful run save a fresh cache, while the
lane restore prefix restores the most recent cache for that lane. Bumping
`CACHE_VERSION` still invalidates all CI caches when a cache-poisoning rollback
is needed.

The CI check lane still keeps its separate `.mango/artifacts/tsbuildinfo/` cache
because shared TypeScript build-info files are deliberately not Turbo task
outputs. Vite optimizer caches also remain separate because they are dependency
optimizer state, not task outputs.

### Future Work

- Remote Cache for CI.
- `--affected` filtering in CI pipelines.
- Package-specific Turbo configuration once the base graph is stable.
